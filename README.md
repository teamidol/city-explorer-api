TRANSPARENCY:

When I thought to move on to the current refactored lab, I thought I’d start with the broken template for it.  It’s Stephen’s code that was used by my professor for code review.  I took note of the video times for replay so I could follow….mar21 12:08p, mar23 10:38p. Then I had a TA help me out Friday night.  The TA had me delete files and codes.  Then we got stuck and the TA admitted going to Code Fellows when Code Fellows wasn’t teaching REACT yet.  Saturday night, I looked at my classmate’s code that I had a template from, to start over.  It looked like he hasn’t been updating as my other classmates I knew were working on their codes that night, so I thought Stephen perhaps planned to work on his on Sunday.  Stephen’s code wasn’t rendering on both the frontend and the backend, so I thought I’ll fix it like I was doing before.  Then I fixed it, both ends were rendering.  I wanted to let Stephen know what I found.  When I looked at the screenshots of his codes, because I couldn't recall everything I did, I couldn’t find much on the difference between what I have and his.  Then I thought, I somehow must’ve pasted his codes on mine the wrong way, which caused me to have errors to fix, hehe.  So these codes are basically from Stephen with guides from another classmate’s working codes and the zoom replays.
